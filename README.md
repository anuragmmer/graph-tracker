# Graph Tracker

Graph Tracker is made for you to track and visualize data points on a plane graph. You can increase, decrease, undo, and add points in the same line; you can also rename the x and y axes to your preference. Use here: [Graph Tracker](https://anuragmmer.github.io/graph-tracker/)

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement Points:** Use buttons to increase or decrease data points on the graph.
- **Undo:** Undo the last action to revert the graph to its previous state.
- **Stablity point:** Add a point in the same line as the last point for continuity.
- **Export/Import Data:** Save and load graph data for later use.
- **Export as PNG:** Export the graph as a high-quality PNG image.
